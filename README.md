# Building a beautiful learning pathways application
The application is being designed to provide the client with a personalised learning pathway. 
The client will connect to our services and provide us with the personal details. 
Followed by filling up their skillset. The careers best matched to their skillset will be displayed.
This would be followed by a suggestions of skills they must acquire 
along with an easy to follow timeline to prepare them for these careers.

Over the years, the rigid education system, highly reliant on theoretical knowledge has proved to become redundant. 
Our application is the solution to this. It provides the user with a well planned, yet flexible enough pathway 
full of practical skillsets to hone, to become well prepared for the career they wish to pursue.

We are providing the client with a well structured timeline to achieve 1
skill at a time and get closer to their goal every single day without getting
overwhelmed by the task. With our step by step approach we ensure that
the client feels taken care of and motivated by the reachability of the
goals. Our timelines will provide the client with some flexibility to plan
the timings on their own but with enough rigidity to ensure that they get
the work done.

We also provide an option to choose a career of your interest and get the
timelines and skill set required for it. The user can view other trending
career opportunities and check the relevant pathway plan for it.
